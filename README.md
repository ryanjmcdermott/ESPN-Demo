## Rock Climber Animated SVG
The rock climber SVG was downloaded from Adobe Stock. I then opened it with **Adobe Illustrator** and optimized the layers for web animation. I exported the SVG, using my new semantic layer names for each layer's `id`. and cleaned up the code further within the `index.html` file.

## Custom Video Player
I created the video player from scratch by following some online tutorials, referencing JS documentation to better understand video-related functions. I also referenced YouTube's video player to some degree since I appreicate their UI.
